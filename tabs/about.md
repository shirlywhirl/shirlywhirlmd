ShirlyWhirlMD was started in 2016 by then beleaguered third year medical student Shirlene Obuobi. It began as a vehicle of self expression during a time of professional growth, and was initially on shared with her classmates at Pritzker School of Medicine. The moniker “ShirlyWhirl” came from one of Shirlene’s friends’ nicknames for her.  ShirlyWhirlMD has been featured in the Lancet, on Axios, Doximity.com, UChicago magazine, and more. 

When she’s not in the hospital (and to be honest, even when she’s in it) she can be found drawing on her iPad or writing on her phone. She has three cats, Balthazar, Minerva and Kahlo.
